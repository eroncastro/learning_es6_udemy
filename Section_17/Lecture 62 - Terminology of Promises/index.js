/*
  ES6 brings a native implementation of Promises

  3 states of Promises:
  - unresolved: waiting for something to finish.
  - resolved: something finished and it all went fine.
  - rejected - something finished and something went bad.

  - 'resolved' -> callback: then
  - 'rejected' -> callback: catch
